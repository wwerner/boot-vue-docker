= Spring Boot + Vue.js + Docker Template

Minimal example of an app running Spring Boot in the backend with a Vue.js SPA as frontend.

* Spring Boot Application with a single HTTP service
* Vue.js application with a sample component
* Webpack Build for the frontend including live reload for development
* API Proxy for the local frontend development server to target the locally running backend
* Maven Build for the backend which also wraps the frontend build
* A Dockerfile to create an image from the jar produced.
* Travis build instructions running the maven and Docker build

The following frameworks where used:

* Spring Boot v2
* Vue.js v2 / Vue CLI 3
* vue-router and vuex
* SCSS styling support
* Docker w/ a minimal JRE 11 base image based on alpine


TODO

* Contract first implementation using swagger, generated server interfaces and JS client.
* CircleCI build, as I prefer it to Travis these days

== Building

. Run `mvn clean install` from the project's root to build the complete application.
. Run `docker build -t wernerw/boot-vue-docker .` or use your own tag

You now have a docker image containig your backend and your frontend.
The generated API documentation is located at `/doc/index.html`

The docker image is pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/wernerw/boot-vue-docker/

== Running

* To run the jar directly, use `java -jar target/boot-vue-docker*.jar`
* To run inside a container on port 8080, use `docker run -p8080:8080 wernerw/boot-vue-docker`

== Development

=== Frontend

Run `npm run serve` from `src/main/frontend` to run the a local dev server for UI development.
The dev server will run on http://localhost:8081.
It proxies the requests to backend HTTP API expected to run on http://localhost:8080/api.
So you can run the backend from your IDE and the frontend in the dev server.

If you run the complete package, the frontend requests will be made against `/api` on the same server.

If you are using IntelliJ/WebStorm, you need to configure the path to the webpack config that is provided by vue-cli for webpack aliases (i.e. `@` for `src`) to work.
